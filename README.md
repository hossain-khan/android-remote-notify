# Android - Remote Notify 🔔
Very specialized app that will notify about remote android device diagnostic data, specifically battery level and storage.

> [!NOTE]  
> Why❓  
> Sometimes android devices you want to monitor might not be co-located with you, and you want to be notified ahead of time of those metrics so that you can take action. For example:
> * 🪫 Battery: If it's going beyond certain level, you want to ensure the device is charging or charged up
> * 💾 Storage: If the device is running low on storage, you may want to crear up storage so that device continues to function properly.
